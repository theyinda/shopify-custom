# Shopify Custom Code

## Overview  
I added a couple of custom sections to the Shopify theme to improve flexibility and design.I built custom layouts for the **header, footer, hero section, product grids, sliders, and collections**. I also included custom CSS and JavaScript to handle styling and functionality.
